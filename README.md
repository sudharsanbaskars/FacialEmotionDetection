# Real-Time Facial Emotion Detection

### Description
- This Repository contains the code files for building a Deep Convolutional Neural Netwok based model to identify the human facial emotions into 5 classes nameley Neutral, Happy, Sad, Fear and Angry.
- The Model was built using Resnet-152 architecture by the transfer learning approch.
- It can able to detect and classify the facial emotions in real time alse.
